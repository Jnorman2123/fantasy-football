This is small personal project that I created to help me get a closer look at NFL player stats for fantasy football purposes.  Using a Django backend and React for the frontend the app allows me to sort players of each position by a large number of stats.  To run the app you will need to clone the repo, I used the github desktop app.  Once opened in your editor you will need to type $pipenv install --dev and then $pipenv shell.  Then in a separate terminal cd into the frontend folder and here I had to update npm with $npm update and then run the program with $npm start.
